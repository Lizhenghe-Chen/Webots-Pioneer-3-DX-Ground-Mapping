# Webots-Pioneer-3-DX-Ground-Mapping
The programming aims to take a partially completed Webots project and extend the controller included to navigate around the arena so that a map can be generated for that arena.  The robot will automatically generate an occupancy grid map based on the sensor values.

The robots will use Pioneer 3-DX: https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pioneer-3dx?version=cyberbotics:R2019a
And the Webots software will be used :https://www.cyberbotics.com

My code is not good enough that some parts of the map are ambiguous and not guaranteed to fit all map types; it only has a basic dead loop avoid method.
