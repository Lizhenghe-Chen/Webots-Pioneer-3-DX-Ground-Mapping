# Webots-Pioneer-3-DX-Ground-Mapping
The aim of the programming is to take a partially completed Webots project, and extend the controller included in the project to navigate around the  arena, so that a map can be generated for that arena.  The robot will automatically generate an occupancy grid map based on the sensor values
